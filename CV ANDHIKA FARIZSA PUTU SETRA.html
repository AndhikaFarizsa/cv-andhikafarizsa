        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p>I am currently a student at Brawijaya University majoring in information systems. I have an interest in
            business and technology, which is why I majored in it. I have an internship experience for 6 months in
            one of the telecommunication companies in Jakarta. There I was in charge of monitoring network
            performance for maintenance with my colleagues. From this experience I not only gained new skills
            and abilities but I also learned a lot about collaboration and working together in a team and I also
            learned to adapt to changes, environments, and new people in the company.
